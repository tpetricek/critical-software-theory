Have we already completely explored the software engineering noosphere with respect to errors and reliability? In this paper, I discuss an novel concept, called "software antifragility", that is unconventional and has the capacity to improve the way we engineer errors and dependability in a disruptive manner. This paper first discusses the foundations of software antifragilty, from classical fault tolerance to the most recent advances on automatic software repair and fault injection in production. This paper then explores the relation between the antifragility of the development process and the antifragility of the resulting software product.},

Similar advances in the design and production of computer software are required in order that this increased contact be as rewarding as possible. The Smalltalk-80 system is a result of a decade of research into creating computer software that is appropriate for producing highly functional and interactive contact with personal computer systems. This book is the first detailed account of the Smalltalk-80 system. It is divided into four major parts:Part One -- an overview of the concepts and syntax of the programming language.Part Two -- an annotated and illustrated specification of the system's functionality.Part Three -- an example of the design and implementation of a moderate-size application.Part Four -- a specification of the Smalltalk-80 virtual machine.}
